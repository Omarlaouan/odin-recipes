        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 aubergines, cut into 1cm chunks</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
            <li>400g can plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tsp red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>pinch of chilli flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>pinch of sugar</li>
            <li>500g gnocchi</li>
            <li>parmesan, or vegetarian alternative, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a deep frying pan and fry the aubergine with a 
                pinch of salt for 10 mins until golden brown and soft.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and fry for 2 mins until smelling fragrant. Tip 
                in the tomatoes, then half fill the tin with water and add that 
                too. Stir in the vinegar, chilli flakes if using, and basil stalks. 
                Mash the tomatoes with a wooden spoon to break them up. Simmer for 
                15 mins until thickened and saucy. Season well, and check for sweetness. 
                Add a pinch of sugar, or a dash more vinegar, if you like.</li>
            <li>Boil the Napolina gnocchi in salted water for 1-2 mins until just 
                starting to rise to the top of the water. Drain, keeping some of 
                the cooking water. Add the gnocchi to the sauce with a splash of 
                the cooking water to loosen if necessary, then remove from the heat. 
                Mix the gnocchi into the sauce, then stir in some of the basil. 
                To serve, scatter with more basil and grate over the parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
